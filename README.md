# Dizi Etudes
Generate dizi etudes.

## Background
As a western flute player, I'm used to practicing certain intervals and fingering changes through scales and etudes.
Chinese music and the dizi use different fingerings and intervals in different frequencies.
This project aims to generate a corpus of exercises to practice that make sense if playing traditional Chinese music so that, at least through note choice and fingering, the player is used to the correct intervals.

## Basic breakdown of project
1. Compile lists related to
- most frequent notes
- most frequent intervals
in as much Chinese music as possible.
These lists can be compiled through frequency analysis, image analysis of jianpu notation, or manual transcription of jianpu notation.  

2. Generate patterns using lilypond and (python? latex? javascript). TBD

3. Modify the patterns to use more appropriate note lengths

4. Generate, print or otherwise display the results for use in practice sessions
